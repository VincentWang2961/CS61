Java use address to point out a object, so if simply using a variable euqals an object, the variable's object will change when original object changes

Each Java type has a diff way to interpret the bits, if declareing a variblae of a certian type in Java, the computer sets exactly enough bits to hold a thing of that type

Java fist allocates a box of bits for each instance variable of the class and fills then with a default value(e.g. 0, null)
